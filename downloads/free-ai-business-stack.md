# The Free AI Business Stack

### Every tool running my 42-agent business, and what each one replaces

This is the actual stack, not a listicle. It runs a content pipeline, a lead
funnel, a paper-trading desk, and a 190-page website on one M1 MacBook with
zero monthly software spend. Version: 2026-08-09.

## 1. The brain — local models, routed by task

**Ollama** (free, ollama.com) running `llama3.2:3b` for fast ops.

The single setting that matters on a 16GB machine: context length. At 32k
context the model holds ~5.9GB resident. Left at its default (model max,
131k) the same model balloons to 17.8GB and OOM-kills whatever else you run.
In the Ollama app: Settings → context length → 32768. Verify:

    grep n_ctx_slot ~/.ollama/logs/server.log | tail -1   # want 32768

Route by task, not loyalty: short/mechanical work goes local; long-context or
frontier-quality tasks go to free cloud tiers (OpenRouter free models, Groq
free tier). ~20 lines of Python picks the lane by prompt length and task type.
Replaces: a $20-200/mo LLM API bill.

## 2. The scheduler — one cron store you can actually query

Everything runs on cron jobs in one SQLite table. Two rules learned the hard
way:

- **A scheduler you can't query is a scheduler you can't trust.** Ours answers
  `select name, enabled, last_run_status from cron_jobs` — 300+ jobs, one query.
- **Silent zombies beat crashes.** A job that logs "ok" and does nothing is
  worse than one that dies loudly. Check the _artifact_ (the file written, the
  row inserted), never the exit banner.

Replaces: Zapier/Make ($20-600/mo at real volume).

## 3. The quality gate — a number in code, not a vibe in a prompt

Nothing publishes below 85/100, scored by a rubric that lives in code.
Prompts drift; regex doesn't. Our gate caught an AI draft inventing a
personal anecdote that _scored 88 on style_ — a code-level fabrication lint
blocked it. If you automate content, build the gate before the generator.
Replaces: an editor on retainer, or public embarrassment.

## 4. The publish-proof rule — no permalink, no success

Every automated post must produce a public URL that a verifier fetches back.
"The API returned 200" is not published. When we audited without this rule,
69% of claimed post "successes" had no evidence they ever existed.
Replaces: dashboards that lie to you.

## 5. Lead capture — a free Cloudflare Worker and a KV namespace

A 100-line Worker takes form posts, validates, writes to KV; a cron pulls
them into SQLite hourly. The Worker returns success only after the KV write
succeeds — a lead that wasn't stored isn't captured.
Replaces: Typeform/ConvertKit capture tiers ($15-50/mo).

## 6. Images and voice — local generation

- **ComfyUI + SD 1.5** for images (SDXL if you have the RAM).
- **Kokoro TTS** for voiceover; run every script through a
  number-normalizer first ("$1,200" → "twelve hundred dollars") or the reads
  are unusable, then verify the audio with local ASR before shipping.

Replaces: Midjourney + ElevenLabs (~$40/mo).

## 7. The kill switch — one flag every autonomous lane checks first

Every lane that can act externally checks a single kill flag before it does
anything, and _fail-closed_: if the flag can't be read, the lane halts. A
publisher that can't confirm it's allowed to publish must not publish.
Cost: ~10 lines. Replaces: the incident you'd otherwise have.

## 8. The free-first rule that makes it all hold

If a paid tool has a capability you need, first ask what the 20% version
looks like built on what you already run. We've built free equivalents of a
lead enricher, a social scheduler, a rank tracker, and an uptime monitor —
none took longer than a day, all of them are boring, all of them work.

**Total monthly cost of everything above: $0.**
The trade is real: you spend setup hours instead of subscription dollars,
and you own every piece afterward.
